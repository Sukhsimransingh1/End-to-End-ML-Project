### 🎓 Student Performance Prediction

# End-to-End Machine Learning Project
This project showcases the design and implementation of a production-ready end-to-end machine learning system, following industry-standard practices rather than relying solely on experimental notebooks.

The application predicts a student’s math score using demographic and academic features. The trained model is deployed via a Flask web application, demonstrating how machine learning solutions can be built, structured, and served in real-world environments.

# 🚀 Key Learnings & Highlights

Building complete end-to-end ML pipelines for real-world use cases

Structuring ML projects for scalability, maintainability, and clarity

Implementing data ingestion, data transformation, and model training pipelines

Writing modular, reusable, and production-quality ML code

Adding custom exception handling and robust logging mechanisms

Maintaining a clear separation between ML logic and deployment logic

Deploying a trained machine learning model as a Flask-based web application
